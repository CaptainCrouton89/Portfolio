## Space Admirals â€” A Board Game
Unfortunately, most of this game was made by hand on physical materials, and so there is very little record of it's creation. However, here, I've posted some of the designs, rules, and concepts that went into producing the game.

### Design
This game was designed to simulate the feeling of commanding a fleet of ships, along with the terror, crushing responsibility, and mentally taxing tactical thinking. Players begin by distributing points to their various ship stats, alotting points to speed, defense, and attack. When the game begins, players have to balance mounting an effective attack with keeping their own base protected. There is no luck, only your ability to reason about your opponent's moves, and plan accordingly. Turns are taken simultaneously, forcing players to make decisions with incomplete knowledge. 

### Results
I play tested over a week with friends, and by the end, we collectively decided the game was too stressful. It seemed balanced, and rules were clear, and decisions felt meaningful, but ultimately, it wasn't fun enough to outweigh the miserable, ever present feeling that your plans would fail and you would spiral into defeat.
