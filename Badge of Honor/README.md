## Badge of Honor
This was a short project I did to familiarize myself with Unity. It is an incomplete, 3 dimensional version of the old arcade shooter game Asteroids. I learned a lot about measuring orientation and position in 3d space when I attempted to create a UI system that lit up different parts of your screen depending on where nearby asteroids were in relation to your ship.
