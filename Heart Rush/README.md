## An RPG From Scratch
This was a 3 month long project. I've loved playing RPGs for a long time, but I've never quite liked the rules as they were. Eventually I got fed up and made my own. Here's the foreward from the rulebook.

### Foreward
Heart Rush, like nearly every other TRPG game out there, was created after someone naïve but determined got fed up with the rules they had been given and figured they could do a better job themselves. In that sense, Heart Rush is another book cut from the same paper. However, over the course of hundreds of grueling hours (okay, they weren’t grueling), I have uncovered, crafted, and polished several gems—several choice mechanics and design decisions that I believe make Heart Rush a game that is worth your time.

Before I vomit forth 30,000 words of rules and mechanics, I’d like to present some of the ideas and goals that led Heart Rush to where it is now, as well as some things that I wanted to avoid. Hopefully this will save you some time—if you think the goals are stupid, you can save yourself some effort and not bother reading the rest of this manual. However, if the design objectives I set out resonate with you, then please read on! I don’t think I will disappoint.

#### Avoid

• Taking turns beating each other over the head with boring combat mechanics

• Realism for realism’s sake

• Exhausting and time consuming prep work • Players who are uninterested in the larger
setting
• Excessive number crunching

• Situations where you feel your character isn’t
strong or important

#### Achieve

• Tactically diverse combat

• Naturally climactic gameplay

• A sort of cross-character balance that doesn’t just mean that all players are re-skins of the same mechanics

• Minimal prepwork

• Non-intrusive aspects of cooperative story telling

I know that it’s hard to believe that a game does all that—after all, it’s the game designer who’s telling you all this, and why the $&%@ should you believe what he has to say, he’s got an agenda. He’s biased. He’s got a warped perspective.
And so, I must confess, those things are all true. I can’t deny any of them, and I know better than to try. However, I may be able to produce some credibility.
First, I am a long time GM and game designer. I’ve been designing games since I was 9, when I made a terrible sea faring war game, and I’ve been playing and running RPG games since I was 12, when I first played a gnome rogue who ate all of the things he stole before picking them out of his excrement in the morning. See, I’m a veteran.

Second, my playgroup enjoys the rules. We’ve run a campaign using them (and I didn’t even GM it!), and for them most part, people loved it. I am still in a play testing phase, and I’m still improving it, so while not every mechanic is seamlessly integrated into the game, many of them are, and they really shine.

Wait, he’s not finished? No, I’m not. That’s where you come in. This manual, as it stands now, is a semi error-free, organized compendium of the rules, and in order to get it the rest of the way, I need your feedback. So, however it’s easiest, whether it’s a loose stream of thought on a word doc, or just a couple of comments here and there, I would greatly appreciate any thoughts you had on what I’ve produced.
